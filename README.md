* Reason for building:

To give developers a easy and uncomplex way of starting off Next.js web development with React.

Pros:

> * Less setup time  
> * More time to focus on the actual project
> * Simple testing playground

Cons:

> * Different development patterns, from typical React starters... For example, **Create React App**
> * You might prefer to setup on your own  
> * Does not implement all of Next.js full functionalities

Regardless of the above. I would truly like you to give it a shot, and try it out in your future Next.js projects.
